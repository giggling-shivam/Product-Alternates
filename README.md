# Product-Alternates
When you go shopping, you may have noticed that some of the products are available in “alternate choices” of colors, prints, etc. This programs provides you with the Product Alternates for your Shopping Convenience.


# process
For finding alternates of the same product in a given e-commerce store, we will use web scraping techniques to extract the necessary data. For this purpose, we use the BeautifulSoup library in combination with the requests library to fetch and parse the HTML content of the store's website.

This code fetches the JSON data containing all products from the provided URL and parses it to extract the product titles and their respective links. Then, it checks for products with similar titles and groups their links together as alternates. Finally, it returns the result as a JSON string.
